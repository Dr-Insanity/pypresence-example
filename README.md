Just an example on how I configured my discord rich presence with pypresence

pypresence made by qwertyquerty

# qwertyquerty's Git profile: https://github.com/qwertyquerty
# pypresence repository: https://github.com/qwertyquerty/pypresence
# pypresence's documentation: https://qwertyquerty.github.io/pypresence/html/index.html

I really need to learn how to write a readme.md *sighs*
